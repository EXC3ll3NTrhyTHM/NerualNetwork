The model for the neural network I created has 3 layers, an input layer, 1 hidden layer and an output layer with 2 neurons. I trained the model using a batch size of 64 and 100 epochs, although I wasn't getting much of an increase or decrease in accuracy no matter how I changed these values, the accuracy I'm getting is around 78%. I mainly followed this tutorial online for writing the model https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ3oqHqRBF0&t=257s&ab_channel=BadriAdhikari while using this one for encoding the categorical data https://pbpython.com/categorical-encoding.html and this one for normalizing the dataset https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26414913/normalize-columns-of-pandas-data-frame. I wonder though how well this neural network is performing because when I look at the final graph where the predicted confidence scores are plotted against the correct label there is the trend I was expecting. It seems sort of randomly distributed so I am unsure of if the neural network is just getting lucky with the 78% accuracy.
